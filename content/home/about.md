The Urban Environments Group focuses on the development and application of models of urban systems. Our research is founded in the methods of
transportation demand analysis. We employ techniques from econometric and simulation modelling to develop models of the interactions between households
and firms. The central objective of the Urban Environments Group is the mitigation of climate change impacts on our society.
